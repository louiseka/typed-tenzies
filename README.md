## What is Typed Tenzies?
**Typed Tenzies** is a fun and interactive dice game built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  

The goal is to roll the dice until all of them show the same value. Players can click on individual dice to "hold" their values between rolls. A confetti animation appears when you win!

## How to Play
1. Click **Roll** to roll all dice.  
2. Click individual dice to **hold** their value.  
3. Continue rolling until all dice show the same number.  
4. When all dice are held and match, you win and **confetti appears**!  
5. Click **New Game** to restart.

## Features
- Built with **TypeScript** for type safety  
- Interactive dice that can be held between rolls  
- Detects when the player has won  
- Fun confetti animation using `react-confetti`  
- Reset the game with a single button click  

## Technologies Used
- **React** – Component-based UI  
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe development  
- **nanoid** – Unique IDs for dice  
- **CSS** – Styling the dice and layout  

## Future Improvements
- Add roll counter and timer
- Add animations for dice rolls  
- Add sound effects for rolling or winning  
- Make the game mobile-friendly
